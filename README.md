# Code Katas 

Welcome to my **Code Katas** repository! This is where I will store and share my daily **Python coding exercises** to sharpen my problem-solving skills, improve my coding speed, and keep my brain in shape.  

---

## Purpose  
- **Consistency**: Practice coding daily to build a habit.  
- **Skill Improvement**: Enhance problem-solving and coding fluency with Python.  
- **Preparedness**: Stay ready for technical interviews, challenges, and real-world problems.  

---

## About This Repository  
This repository contains **Python solutions** for coding challenges or *katas* that I work on daily. Each kata is designed to target a specific concept, such as:  
- Algorithms  
- Data Structures  
- Logical Reasoning  
- Optimization Problems  

---

## Structure  

Each exercise will be stored as a single Python file in the root directory, following this naming convention:  

```plaintext
day_number_title.py
```

- `day_number` â†’ The sequential day of the kata (e.g., 001, 002).  
- `title` â†’ A short description of the exercise (e.g., `fibonacci`, `string_reversal`).  

Each file will include a **header comment** at the top with the problem description, like this:  

```python
# Day 001: Fibonacci Sequence
# Description: Write a function to generate the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
# Example Input: 5
# Example Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```

Example:
```plaintext
/
â”œâ”€â”€ 001_fibonacci.py  
â”œâ”€â”€ 002_string_reversal.py  
â”œâ”€â”€ 003_prime_check.py  
â””â”€â”€ README.md  
```

## Inspiration  
These katas are inspired by platforms like:  
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)  
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)  
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)  
- Other random problems I come across.

## A Note to Myself  

Consistency is keyâ€”no matter how small the progress, *just keep coding.* ðŸš€
